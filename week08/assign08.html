	  <p>&bull; The first reading assignment mentions a form of authentication that is done with a server, however GitPages lacks support for such things as far as I know. Can this be done with only clientside code or will we need to use an actual server for Sleep Outside in the near future?</p><img alt="JSON Web token auth" src="https://auth0.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17.png" height="450"><br><br>
	  <p>&bull; The speaker does make a point about used code having a drop in support due to a lack of programmer interest, but at the same time I as a programmer do not desire to develop anything that I'm not interested in if I it doesn't make me a profit somehow.</p><br>
	  <p>&bull; "Architecting code?" Is that a thing? If so, what does it mean?</p><br>
	  <p>&bull; I've tried joining some open-source projects, but I found it too hard to get to know the code or the community after it has already started for a while. They already seem to have their rhythm going without me and no one really seemed interested in introducing me to their code.</p><br>
	  <p>&bull; The more I watch the video the more it seems to me like the speaker is ranting, and the people in the front row seats look way too relaxed to even care. If anything, they look ready to sleep given how inclined those chairs(?) are.</p><br>
